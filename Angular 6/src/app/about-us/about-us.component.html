  <p style="text-align:justify;">Human Study e.V. is a german based non-profit organisation with more than 10 years of experience in delivering prosthetic & orthotic (P&O) education by means of a specific blended learning methodology. Our goal is to create educational opportunities in prosthetics and orthotics in regions and countries where formal and internationally recognized education in this professional area does not exist.

    Our blended learning methodology effectively combines the e-learning practices with on-site hands-on clinical workshop seminars, allowing the participants to study and at the same time stay productive in their workshop facilities, treating patients and keeping a regular income.

    The delivery of our comprehensive Cat II level educational programs has been a positive experience and presents a steady progress in the development of customized and innovative blended education since 2007. Owing to the expertise we have thus acquired, we set about to develop an opportunity of offering the blended learning education in P&O on a higher academic level. The aim of this development has been to create generations of teachers and trainers within the profession, to provide more sustainable solutions to the shortage of qualified personnel in the world.

    Our educational programs on Cat II and Bachelor/Cat I levels are especially aimed at the countries and regions where quality of services provided is poor or neglected and/or not in compliance with the recommendations of the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics (ISPO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
